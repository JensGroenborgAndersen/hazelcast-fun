Hazelcast Fun
====

This is a little prototype project for demonstrating hazelcast database backed replicated maps. 
A map that is distributed across cluster members and written to a database.

**Please beware that this project features imports in the hazelcast.xml which is currently not supported in our official Payara 6 image**
